# GroupMeBot
Simple GroupMe bot made using GroupMe's API. This project aims to add some useful funcitonality and games to GroupMe chats.
To use the project, just pull the files onto your webserver and follow GroupMe's API tutorial to create a new bot and set the
callback URL to the groupme.php file on your own webserver. More info found here: https://dev.groupme.com/tutorials/bots

Then, create a config.php file with your own api keys/url and bot id. Or you can set these in the helper file itself.
